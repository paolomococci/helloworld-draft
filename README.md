# helloworld-draft
Draft of hello world web application with Spring Boot and Vaadin.
Once you have downloaded the generic project template generated on the Spring Initializr website, with the specific requests you can deduce from the pom file, you can import it into the preferred IDE and add the source files present here.
Please, be careful to the proper package system of the Java language.
Thank you.
